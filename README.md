# ABOUT
This is a fork of [Scid vs PC](https://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/) which is itself a fork of [Scid](https://scid.sourceforge.net/)<br>
This fork will includes some features I wanted to add to the original Scid vs PC.<br>
Note that this fork is not guaranteed to be in sync with the [Scid vs PC repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scidvspc/files/) and will probably be left behind, although I will try to keep it updated as much as I can.<br>
Pull requests are welcome but not warranted<br>
The current fork is a modification of `Scid vs. PC 4.26 (Feb 10, 2025)`<br>
# Build Compatibility
Prebuilt binaries for x86_64 GNU/Linux systems are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/mayankxor/XORvsPC/releases).

They will not run on Windows, macOS, or non-x86_64 architectures. For other systems, build from source.

# CHECKLIST

 - [x] Option to highlight legal squares upon selecting(or holding) a piece
 - [ ] More icons in comment editor window
 - [ ] A way to get game review(book, best, great, etc moves) on analysis
